Hello, world!
=============

Welcome to the [Rdio][2] engineering blog!

At Rdio, we've always had an ambitious engineering team. We have a small team
and some big projects. As we build out our core infrastructure, support many
mobile platforms, and build a complex web app, we keep learning things.
This is intended to be a place where Rdio engineers can share their experiences,
and hopefully contribute to the community.

Rdio the company has been around for a lot longer than many people know (since
August 2008!) and we've learned a lot about not only the technologies we use but
also scaling the product, the team, and the codebase. We hope to use this blog as a
forum for all of those things, as well as opinions on the software landscape as
we see it. Our current stack is a combination of Django/Python, Erlang,
Xamarin/C#, some ActionScript, lots of JavaScript, several small languages for
platforms that have their own SDKs, and even a little C/C++. Watch this space
for riveting expos√©s on all of these!

This blog itself is a demonstration of some of the cool things we've been
working on. The Rdio web app and many other aspects of our business are built
on an framework we've built on top of [Backbone.js][3]. As we move towards
making that more generally available, we need to prove that it can work outside
of some of the other infrastructure we've built. This is an initial attempt at
that. If you're familiar with the web inspector, fire it up and take a look
at how the structure of the application mirrors that of Rdio. It's not the
highly optimized, SEO friendly version we've got running on the Rdio side of
things, but it's a first step, and one that hopefully we'll be able to share
with the community in the coming months.

As always, if you're interested in helping us out with this and other challenges,
[we're hiring!][4]
