Hello, world!
=============

Welcome to the [Rdio][2] engineering blog!

At Rdio, we've been growing rapidly over the past year in all aspects of the
company, and engineering has been no exception. As we build out our core
infrastructure, support many mobile platforms, and build a complex web app,
we keep learning things. This is intended to be a place where Rdio engineers
can share their experiences, and hopefully contribute to the community.

This blog itself is a demonstration of some of the cool things we've been
working on. The Rdio web app and many other aspects of our business are built
on an framework we've built on top of [Backbone.js][3]. As we move towards
making that more generally available, we need to prove that it can work outside
of some of the other infrastructure we've built. This is an initial attempt at
that. If you're familiar with the web inspector, fire it up and take a look
at how the structure of the application mirrors that of Rdio. It's not the 
highly optimized version we've got running on the Rdio side of things, but it's
a first step, and one that hopefully we'll be able to share with the community
in the coming months.

As always, if you're interested in helping us out with this and other challenges,
[we're hiring!][4]
